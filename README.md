### Challenges
1. I wasn't sure what the correct font family was and so I just copied what was on your website.
2. Font sizes were a little challenging to determine just basing on what was on the mock.
3. Time. I timeboxed myself to about 90 minutes. There were more things I would have like to have built.
4. I decided not to go with a traditional table as going with plain divs seem to offer more flexibility.

### Possible Improvements
1. I am unsure what the "Show More" functionality was for - to show more graphs or rows? At any rate, iff I had more time, I would add a proper "Show More" functionality where more rows are displayed.
2. Responsive design. I would have liked to have the rows to be more properly responsive.
3. Proper aligments based on mock.
